# Eventry
This app displays the information about various events.

This is a practice Next JS project. In the next version I'll deploy with full functionalities.

Possible improvements:
1. Store the auth in localstorage instead of context so that the authentication persists. JWT based authentication/OAuth/firebase email-password authentication.
2. Use mongodb atlas (cloud database) instead of local database.
3. Make the map functional.
4. Deploy in vercel.
